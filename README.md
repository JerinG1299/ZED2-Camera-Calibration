# ZED2-Camera-Calibration
Calibration script for stereo ZED 2 camera setup using OpenCV and Stereolabs SDK for accurate depth and 3D reconstruction.
# ZED 2 Camera Calibration using OpenCV and Stereolabs SDK

This project provides a Python script for **stereo camera calibration** of the ZED 2 camera using a checkerboard pattern. The goal is to compute intrinsic parameters (camera matrix and distortion coefficients) which are essential for 3D vision applications like depth estimation and stereo reconstruction.
